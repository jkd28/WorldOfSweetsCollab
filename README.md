# World Of Sweets Collaboration
This was a project developed as part of a team in the University of Pittsburgh's Software Engineering course (COE 1530).  I worked with several teammates to create a project that complied with requirements set forth by the instructor of the class.  These requirements were relatively flexible, giving us a large amount of freedom in how we designed the project.  Using the `gradle` build system, we were able to maintain the scale of the project and the unit tests that accompanied it.  

The project was titled "World of Sweets" and is played by drawing colored cards and moving according to the color drawn.  There are several additional features we added, such as music, the ability to throw Boomerangs to turn your opponents around, and even a "Dad Mode" which always chooses the worst card for players named "Dad" so that the kids can win. 

 This is by far the largest project I have ever worked on as part of a class assignment.  All in all, this was a very educational project, and I am happy to have worked with the team.  

## Usage    
The gradle build tool is required to run this program.  
Build: `gradle build`  
Execute:  `gradle run`

# Manual Test Descriptions  
## Player Movement  
 * Test Special Card Movement  
 **Execution:** Begin a new game, entering names and selecting tokens for each player.  Draw a few cards.  Continue drawing until a special card is drawn.  
 **Expected Results:** The drawing player's token advances (or regresses) to the space denoted by the special card that has been drawn.  

 * Test Player Movement  
 **Execution:** Begin a new game, with each player entering names and selecting tokens.  Begin play as normal.  
 **Expected Results:** For each card that is drawn, the player who drew it moves to the correct next space as denoted by the card.  

### Timer
 *  Test Timer Run  
 **Execution:**  Begin game and draw first card.  
 **Expected Results:** The timer starts after the first draw.  

 *  Test Time Increment  
 **Execution**: Begin game and draw first card.  Let game sit until the timer ticks over to minutes, then to hours.  
 **Expected Results:** The timer increments every second with the format of HH:MM:SS.

### Tokens
 *  Test Token Display  
 **Execution:** Begin game and select tokens for each player.  
 **Expected Results:** The tokens are properly displayed on the first space before the first card is drawn.

 * Test Token Assignment  
 **Execution:** Begin game and select unique tokens for each player.  
 **Expected Results:** Each player's token is assigned properly by having each player draw a card for the first round of play, and their unique token is the one that moves.

### Music
 *  Test Music Play  
 **Execution:** Begin the game. All players enter their names.  
 **Expected Result:** The music begins playing immediately after the last player enters their name.

 *  Test Music Termination On Game End  
 **Execution:** Begin the game. After playing through a complete game with music in the background, exit the game.  
 **Expected Result:** The music terminates upon game end.  

 *  Test Music Termination On Game Exit  
 **Execution:** Begin the game.  Ensure music begins playing.  After a few card draws, exit the game.  
 **Expected Results:** The music terminates upon exit.  

 *  Test Missing Music  
 **Execution:** Remove the music file from the game files.  Start the program.  All players enter their names.  
 **Expected Results:** The game throws an error ("Music: file not found") and terminates.

### Save & Load
 *  Test Save Game  
 **Execution:** Start a brand new game, draw several cards, select the "Save" button and enter a brand new, valid save-file name (e.g. "WorldOfSweets Save File.ser") and select "OK".  
 **Expected Results:** WorldOfSweets displays a "Game was saved successfully!" type of prompt, and the game properly resumes. This includes all aspects of the game (game timer resumes, drawing cards works properly, player movement works properly, etc.).  

 *  Test Invalid Save-File Name  
 **Execution:** Start a brand new game, draw several cards, select the "Save" button, enter a brand new, invalid save-file name (e.g. "FakeFile.rofl").  
 **Expected Results:** The game informs the user that the entered file name is invalid, and asks them to try again.  

 *  Test Mid-Game Save Prompt  
 **Execution:** Start a brand new game, draw several cards, select the "X" (exit) button at the top of the game's frame.  
 **Expected Results:** The game asks the user if they want to save their progress before quitting.

 *  Test Load Game  
  **Execution:** Begin the game and answer "Yes" to the prompt asking if you want to load a saved game.  Select a valid save file to load, and hit "OK".  
  **Expected Results:** WorldOfSweets returns to the exact state as saved in the save-file, and the game resumes with working functionality.

 *  Test Load Invalid Game  
 **Execution:** Begin the game and answer "Yes" to the prompt asking if you want to load a saved game.  Select an invalid save file (e.g. type in a filename that doesn't exist, select a save-file from a previous iteration of the WorldOfSweets codebase, etc.)  
 **Expected Results:** WorldOfSweets notifies you that it was unable to load the game successfully, and instead starts a new game.


 *  Test Load Game with Invalid Checksum  
 **Execution:** Start a brand new game, draw a few cards and let some time pass, save the game to file, and exit WorldOfSweets. In a text editor, modify the checksum file for the save file you just created (i.e. if you just created a file called "WorldOfSweets Saved Game.ser", there should be a complementary file called "WorldOfSweets Saved Game.ser.chksum" containing the checksum. Alter one or more of the numbers). Re-open WorldOfSweets and try to load the save file you just saved.  
 **Expected Results:** WorldOfSweets forcibly exits with a `ChecksumValueException`.
